# REACT PWA Reference Storefront Quick Start Guide

## Overview

The REACT PWA Reference Storefront is a flexible e-commerce website built on Elastic Pathâ€™s RESTful e-commerce API, Cortex API. Through the Cortex API, the storefront uses the e-commerce capabilities provided by Elastic Path Commerce and gets data in a RESTful manner. For more information about the storefront, see [REACT PWA Reference Storefront Documentation](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/storefront-react).

The Storefront is designed as an open source mobile Progressive Web Application (PWA) that has the capabilities for local browser storage page caching and persistent session management. This PWA is built using the ['React.js'](https://reactjs.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/), and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) technologies. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) enable the application layer interactions through the configurable web server. For more information about the software requirements, see the [Requirements and Specifications](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/storefront-react/docs/requirements.html) section.
