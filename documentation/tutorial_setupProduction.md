# Tutorial: Setting Up a Production Instance

### Requirements

* A development environment
* An Elastic Path training virtual machine

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you are familiar with the following third-party technologies:<br>
* Git
* Node.js
* Visual Studio Code with the following extensions:
   * Debugger for Chrome
   * ESLint extension

### Example

1. Clone or pull the `react-pwa-reference-storefront` repository into your directory.<br>
2. Navigate to the `react-pwa-reference-storefront` directory.<br>
3. Build a production Docker image by running the following command:<br>
`docker build -t ep-store -f ./docker/prod/Dockerfile .` <br>
4. Push the `ep-store` image to the Docker repository.<br>
5. Navigate to the `docker/prod/` directory.<br>
6. Copy the following files to the user home directory on the remote host:<br>
    * `docker-compose.yaml`
    * `nginx.conf`
7. In the `nginx.conf` file, update the following parameters:
    * `$CORTEX_URL` with Cortex server URL.
    * `$DOMAIN` with domain name without `http://`.
    * `$SSL_CERT_PATH` with the certificate file path in the remote server. <br>
    For example, `/etc/letsencrypt/live/reference.elasticpath.com/fullchain.pem`. <br>
    * `$SSL_KEY_PATH` with the path of the private key in the remote server.<br>
    For example, `/etc/letsencrypt/live/reference.elasticpath.com/privkey.pem`. <br>
    **Note:** You can use the certificate generated by any certificate provider, such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).
8. In the `docker-compose.yaml` file, update the following parameters:
    * `$DOCKER_REPO` with `ep-store`.
    * `$SSL_CERT_PATH` with the certificate file path in the remote server .
    <br> For example, `/etc/letsencrypt/live/reference.elasticpath.com/fullchain.pem`.<br>
    * `$SSL_KEY_PATH` with the path of the private key in the remote server.
    <br> For example, `/etc/letsencrypt/live/reference.elasticpath.com/privkey.pem`.<br>
9. Run the following Docker command to start the Docker container created for the Docker image:<br/>
    * `docker-compose up -d` <br>
