# REACT Reference Storefront

## Overview

The Reference Storefront is divided into containers (Pages) and React components. Each page in the storefront is composed of various components that fulfills the purpose of the page. For example, Home, Cart, Categories, Checkout, and Registration are separate Pages. Each page consists of various components, such as Navigation, Footer, Product List, or Products.

You can access the React Reference Storefront on various devices, such as tablets, mobile phones, or computers. The Storefront is designed as an open source Mobile Progressive Web Application (PWA) that has the capabilities for local browser storage page caching and persistent session management. This PWA is built using the ['React.js'](https://reactjs.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/), and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) technologies. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) enables the application layer interactions through configurable web server.

With theming, you can change the presentation of the React Reference Storefront without modifying the JavaScript. React Reference Storefront uses the dynamic stylesheet language, [less](http://lesscss.org/), to changes the themes. You can change the look and feel of the storefront by modifying the corresponding `{less}` files.

Each theme is a set of `{less}` files, which can be compiled into a `style.css` file. The `{less}` files for each theme are organized in the same order as the storefront is presented.
For example, `CartPage.less` contains the CSS for the cartâ€™s container page, and  `cart.main.less` contains the CSS for the main component in the cart page.

### Features



## Platform Architecture

<br/>

### Presentation Layer

The presentation layer provides the user interface management capabilities using a modern UI framework that uses the following configuration files:
- `index.html` - The front-end html document that is populated by the REACT pages and components.
- `App.js` - The javascript file that contains the import instructions for the React components and the subsequent layers. When this script is run, all subsequent components are loaded on the page.
- `index.js` - The javascript file that contains the import instructions for the required frameworks, such as bootstrap, React, and renders the `App.js` file. This file also registers the PWA service worker.
- `CSS` - The file that consists of the  custom stylesheets and static page assets for the storefront front-end presentation.

### Page Assets

The storefront loads the page assets  through a webserver. For the default implementation of the storefront, you need not connect a Content Management System (CMS) with the storefront or synchronize catalog data between the storefront and CMS.

A page is composed of the static assets for PWA. These assets are included within the web application and are loaded by the web application. The catalog images stored in the Amazon S3 bucket are retrieved using the SKU naming conventions. You can configure the SKU naming conventions in the `/src/ep.config.json` file, which contains the configurations for the reference storefront.

When you add new products and create corresponding SKUs in Elastic Path Commerce, to add new catalog images for these products, upload the images to the Amazon S3 bucket that is used for PWA. When you create custom landing page for categories or products, you can upload images and content for the page to the Amazon S3 bucket that PWA uses for the page.

### Route/Page Layer

The route/page layer routes browser requests to the subsequent pages. This layer is composed of:
* `routes.js` - The javascript file that contains routes and mappings to the `.jsx` React pages.
* Pages - The top-level pages that loads the required components for each page.
* Service worker - A service worker  created using Workbox to manage caching and PWA capabilities.

### Component Layer

The component layer provides the components to be loaded within each page. The components are created depending on the functionality of the item that the pages interact with or loads.

### Web Server Layer

Web Server Layer enables the interaction between the application and the service layer. This layer is composed of:
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The web server implementation that loads the React PWA.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - The  javascript module bundler that captures the modules with dependencies and generate static assets for the modules.

### API Layer

The application layer of React Reference Storefront is built on [Cortex API](https://developers.elasticpath.com/commerce/7.3/Cortex-API-Front-End-Development/Getting-Started/Introduction). Through Cortex API, the storefront get to use the ecommerce capabilities provided Elastic Path Commerce. PWA interacts with the required services through this layer.
