The REACT PWA Reference Storefront is a flexible e-commerce website backed by Elastic Path’s Cortex API.
It is comprised of the latest technologies, is designed for extensibility.

E-commerce functionality (cart, authentication, profile, search, etc.) is separated from the website’s
presentation, allowing
front-end developers to work on the CSS without having to touch the JavaScript, while JavaScript developers
can develop
functionality without having to touch the front end. Each customization layer is separated from the core
code, so
neither developer has to touch the Storefront’s engine.

What is the Cortex API?
-------------------
Cortex API is Elastic Path's powerful [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) e-commerce API.
The API can surface up data from any e-commerce backend system in a RESTful manner.

To learn more about Cortex API, see our [Developer Portal](http://touchpoint-developers.elasticpath.com/).
