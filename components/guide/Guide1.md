# React Components Library

Accelerate your storefront development with this library of React components implemented by Elastic Path. Reuse the components as-is or customize them to suit your vision of your storefront.

## Getting Started

To learn how to install the component library and consume the components, see [UI Components](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/storefront-react/docs/dev-guides/consuming.html) in the React PWA Reference Storefront documentation.

To see how these components work together, open the [Reference Storefront](https://referenceb2b.elasticpath.com/).

## Storybook

This library is presented with Storybook. Storybook is a third-party, open-source tool for developing, testing, and displaying UI components in isolation of an application. In general, a story in the Storybook displays a single visual state of a component. With Storybook, you can review the UI components and choose the ones that you want to consume.

You can choose to view the components in a public instance or local instance of Storybook.

### Public Instance

If you are viewing the [public instance of the Storybook](https://ui-components.elasticpath.com/?path=/story/components-appheadermain--appheadermain), you can:

- Browse the React components offered by Elastic Path.
- Select a component to view the user interface, and interact with some components.
- Understand how a component works by reviewing the content in the Readme and Story tabs.

### Local Instance

If you are viewing a local instance of the Storybook, you can also:

- Change the component styling in the `.less` source file and see the style change in Storybook.
- Add your own components and view them in Storybook.
- Experiment with values in the Knobs tab.
